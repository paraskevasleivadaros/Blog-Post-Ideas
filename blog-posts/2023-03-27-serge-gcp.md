Serge is a chat interface that allows you to run Alpaca models without the need for any API keys. It is entirely self-hosted, fits on 4GB of RAM, and can run on the CPU. In this guide, we'll walk you through the steps required to deploy Serge on Google Cloud Platform (GCP).

Before we get started, make sure you have a GCP account set up and are familiar with the basic concepts of GCP, including creating and managing virtual machines, and setting up firewall rules.

## Step 1: Create a Virtual Machine

The first step in deploying Serge on GCP is to create a virtual machine. We recommend using a machine type with at least 4GB of RAM and a CPU. You can choose any operating system you like, but I recommend using a Linux-based distribution such as Ubuntu or Debian.

To create a virtual machine in GCP, follow these steps:

- Go to [console.cloud.google.com](https://console.cloud.google.com) and create a new project (eg. serge)
- Navigate to the Compute Engine section and click on the `Create Instance` button
- Choose the machine type you want to use, and choose the region and the zone for your instance. In this example, we are picking the `us-central1` region and `us-central1-c` zone. Also, we are gonna use a `e2-standard-8` machine so that we can run models up to 30 billion parameters:

- Select the operating system you want to run and configure the disk space. In this example, we are gonna use Ubuntu 22.04 LTS for the OS and a 250GB SSD as our boot disk. Click on the `SELECT` button:

- Configure the firewall to allow `HTTP/HTTPS` traffic:

- Leave everything else as it is and click on the `CREATE` button to create your virtual machine
- Navigate to VPC networks and click on `default`
- From the sidebar menu click on `Firewall` and then click on the `Create a firewall rule` button
- Choose a name (eg serge-firewall) and on the `Target tags` field fill in the `http-server` tag. In the Source IPv4 ranges enable all by filling in `0.0.0.0/0`. In the Protocols and ports section click on `TCP` and open port `8008` (we will need it for later). Click on the `SAVE` button:

## Step 2: Install Dependencies

To get started with `serge`, follow these steps:

- Navigate to VM Instances and click on the `SSH` button
- Clone the `serge` repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/nsarrazin/serge.git
cd serge
```

- Start the Docker container:
```bash
sudo docker-compose up -d
```

- Download the required tokenizers:
```bash
sudo docker-compose exec serge python3 /usr/src/app/api/utils/download.py tokenizer 7B
sudo docker-compose exec serge python3 /usr/src/app/api/utils/download.py tokenizer 13B
sudo docker-compose exec serge python3 /usr/src/app/api/utils/download.py tokenizer 30B
```
Please note that the models occupy the following storage space: 7B requires 4.21G, 13B requires 8.14G, and 30B requires 20.3G

## Step 3: Access the API

Once you've installed the dependencies and started the Docker container, you can access the `serge` API by following these steps:

- Navigate to VM Instances and copy the `External IP` of your machine

- Open your web browser and navigate to [http://external-ip:8008/](http://external-ip:8008/) and Voil√†:

- You should see the `serge` homepage, which means that the API is up and running!

- To use the API, make requests to [http://external-ip:8008/api/](http://external-ip:8008/api/):

That's it! You're now ready to use `serge` on GCP. Happy coding!
